 Further verification of the downloaded Tomcat
 
 # For a production environment, this verification would be standard practice; but it's a good idea
   for a learning environment as well.

   ## The standard command-line utility for checking digital signatures is called 'gpg' (GNU Privacy Guard).
      ### 'gpg' is a suite of utilities, including a utility to digitally sign something.

   ## On Windows, 'certutil' can be used for the same purpose, and on a Mac 'codesign' is the built-in 
      equivalent.

      ## However, 'gpg' has become an at least informal standard, and versions are available for
         Windows and Macs:

                  https://www.gnupg.org/download/

         For simplicity, this handout sticks mainly with the 'gpg' utility.

 # Verifying Tomcat's digital signature, as all of its downloadable archives are digitally signed.

   ## Key Pair:

      -- private key, kept secret by the owner
      -- public key, distributed to anyone who wants a copy

   ## The owner of the private key uses it to digitally sign something (e.g., a ZIP file).
   ## The verifier of the signature uses the public key to verify the digital signature.

   ## Here's a depiction of what we're doing in verifying Tomcat's digital signature:
 
                    Unix-like systems have 'gpg' utility to do this, Windows has 'certUtil'
                                                    \
                                                +----------+
         digital signature--------------------->|          |
                                                | verifier |------>yes or no
         public key from signer's key pair----->|          |
                                                +----------+

       ### Here's the signature, from the 'pgp' entry that precedes the 'md5' and 'sha1' 
           entries on the download page. I've placeed this digital signature in the file
           'ds.asc', but any file name would do:

          -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----

       ### We now need a series of commands to get Tomcat's public key so that we can verify
           this signature. The commands are given below with comments starting '##'.

           ## Try to verify, even though we lack the public code to do so.
           % gpg --verify ds.asc apache-tomcat-8.0.33.zip
               gpg: Signature made Fri 18 Mar 2016 03:33:19 PM CDT using RSA key ID 2F6059E7
               gpg: Can't check signature: public key not found

           ## Get Tomcat public key from reliable source (e.g., MIT): use 'key ID' above
           % gpg --keyserver pgpkeys.mit.edu --recv-key 2F6059E7
               gpg: requesting key 2F6059E7 from hkp server pgpkeys.mit.edu
               gpg: key 2F6059E7: public key "Mark E D Thomas <markt@apache.org>" imported
               gpg: no ultimately trusted keys found
               gpg: Total number processed: 1 
               gpg:               imported: 1  (RSA: 1)

           ## Now try the verification again.
           % gpg --verify ds.asc apache-tomcat-8.0.33.zip
               gpg: Signature made Fri 18 Mar 2016 03:33:19 PM CDT using RSA key ID 2F6059E7
               gpg: Good signature from "Mark E D Thomas <markt@apache.org>"
               gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
               gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.

           ## Get some confirmation on the fingerprint. Tomcat lists all of the developer keys
           ## in the file (available from the download page) in the file KEYS.
           ## The critical question: How much trust do you need to accept the signature?
